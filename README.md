# Credit-Card-Approval-Predictor

This is based on a course on DataCamp . Here I use logistic regression to predict the approval of credit card application request of a customer and then further optimize the model using GridSearchCV.
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
